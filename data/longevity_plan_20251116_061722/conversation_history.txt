Service Planner: To align Alice's plan with her budget of $1000 while still addressing her goals, we can reduce the number of lifestyle coaching sessions. Here’s a further refined plan:

### Finalized 6-Month Plan:

#### Month 1:
- **Baseline Bloodwork**: Assess current lipid levels and glucose.  
  - **Cost**: $120

#### Month 2:
- **VO2 Test**: Establish baseline VO2 max.  
  - **Cost**: $150
- **Lifestyle Coaching**: 1 session to focus on exercise strategies to improve VO2 max.  
  - **Cost**: $80

#### Month 3:
- **Lifestyle Coaching**: 1 session to continue optimizing sleep and dietary strategies for LDL reduction.  
  - **Cost**: $80

#### Month 4:
- **Follow-up Baseline Bloodwork**: Monitor progress on LDL levels.  
  - **Cost**: $120
- **Lifestyle Coaching**: 1 session to adjust strategies based on bloodwork results.  
  - **Cost**: $80

#### Month 5:
- **VO2 Test**: Reassess VO2 max to measure improvement.  
  - **Cost**: $150

#### Month 6:
- **Scan**: Comprehensive assessment of overall health.  
  - **Cost**: $300

### Summary of Costs:
- **Bloodwork**: $120 (Month 1) + $120 (Month 4) = $240
- **VO2 Tests**: $150 (Month 2) + $150 (Month 5) = $300
- **Scan**: $300 (Month 6)
- **Lifestyle Coaching**: $80 (Month 2) + $80 (Month 3) + $80 (Month 4) = $240

### Total Estimated Cost: 
- $240 (Bloodwork) + $300 (VO2 Tests) + $300 (Scan) + $240 (Coaching) = **$1080**

### Adjustments:
This plan is still slightly over budget. To fit within the $1000 budget, we can consider reducing one of the lifestyle coaching sessions. 

Would you like to proceed with this adjustment or explore other options?
